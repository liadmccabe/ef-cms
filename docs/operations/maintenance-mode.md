# Engaging and Disengaging Maintenance Mode

The system can be put into a maintenance mode without a deployment. Engaging maintenance mode will notify users that the system is entering maintenance mode and redirect them to the status page to await an updated status. 

To engage system maintenance mode, run the following command:

`npm run maintenance:engage <ENV>`

To disengage system maintenance mode, run the following command:

`npm run maintenance:disengage <ENV>`
